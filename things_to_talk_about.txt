Things to talk about

1. Who am I
2. Release Engineering
	- Responsible for creating a pipeline to turn source code into products
	- Includes building, signing, packaging, updating and testing on a diverse set of desktop and mobile platforms, across several versions
	- it has been said that the difference between manufacturing software in a startup/small team vs an industrial strength company is releng

3. Release Promotion
	- Also known as 'build promotion'
	- Currently the process of creating a release involves manually starting the build/test/packaging process with a different configuration from the builds produced by CI
	- Builds produced through this method would not go through CI testing
	- Release Promotion makes the process more efficient by 
		- Eliminating the second build process.
		- Reporting all release related tasks to Treeherder (improving visibility)
		- Increases confidence in the quality of the product, as the shipped application is now the exact application that has gone through testing

5. Pulse-Notify
	- Purpose/Use Cases
		- Small service used to make release-promotion operational tasks more efficient
		- Sends notification emails similar to those sent by build-automation
		- Streams colour-coded notification to an IRC channel
		- Collects and organizes logs for release related tasks
	- Technical Info
		- Asynchronous Python 3.5
		- Built on top of Taskcluster and Mozilla Pulse
		- Plugin architecture
	- How it works
		- Initializes plugin objects, named identities
		- Listens for release-promotion related events on Mozilla Pulse
		- Pulls the corresponding taskcluster task definition
		- Skims the task for a section marked "extra/notifications"
		- Depending on the task status/AMQP exchange detected, pulls a notification configuration out of the task
		- Calls 'notify' method for plugins enabled in the configuration
