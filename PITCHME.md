### RelEng Services

- Move all RelEng services to one repo              |
- Define all APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI              |
- Provide a single front-end (a la TaskCluster)     |
- Build all services with Nix/Docker                |

+++

### Why One Repository?

- Service discoverability                                   |
- Re-use common components (CLI tools, Flask plugins etc)   |
- Quick overview of how/where/what is running               |

### Why Swagger/OpenAPI?
![Swagger](assets/swagger.png)

- Use *Connexion* library                                   |
- Auto-generate SwaggerUI                                   |
- Client library generation                                 |
- API specifications in YAML                                |
