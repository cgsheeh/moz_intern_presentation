# Mozilla Intern Presentation

This repo contains the slide deck for my Mozilla summer 2016 intern presentation. The slides were built using the reveal.js framework. To render/view the slides visit [https://cgsheeh.github.io/moz_intern_presentation](https://cgsheeh.github.io/moz_intern_presentation), and the actual presentation can be viewed on Air Mozilla at [https://air.mozilla.org/release-promotion-keeping-tabs-on-automation/](https://air.mozilla.org/release-promotion-keeping-tabs-on-automation/)
